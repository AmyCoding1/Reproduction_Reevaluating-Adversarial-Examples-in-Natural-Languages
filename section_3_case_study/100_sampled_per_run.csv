protocols we were also warned a grand total of 7 times in 25 minutes not to get comfortable because we would be changing buses again shortly which was ironic because the seats appeared to be made from repurposed potato sacks and were every bit as itchy with warm water bottle in hand and mild rash on leg, we were corralled into a stark labyrinth of a building where instruction on how the people with green stickers should enter the green line and people with red stickers should enter the red line lasted inordinately long because it was clear that some of the group spoke no english, we were then subjected to that feeble and oft insulting tactic where we were spoken to as if we might be near deaf imbeciles as if speaking slowly at high volume and dumbing down ones vocabulary and sentence structure has somehow ever caused a person to spontaneously comprehend english or has ever bridged any language barrier at all after a lot of bad noise, we were given a generic juice box, a rubbery danish and access to a foul cauldron of coffee like fluid we then boarded another bus where we were entertained by the musings of a large man named walter as we made the long trek to the grand canyon

chopper pilot ( who was pretty easy on the eyes i 'll have you know ) swooped and wove us through the picturesque hole in the ground we came so far to see however, no sooner had this thrilling ride concluded did we realize what was in store for us at the bottom of the canyon as altitude and standards began to plummet in perfect synchronicity, it was time to forge the colorado river on a guided pontoon tour that's worthlessness can not be overstated as far as our tour guide, it wasn't so much that english wasn't his second or third language that pissed me off, it was that english wasn't a language at all for him he briefly became useful when it became apparent that our boat was going to stall every 8 or 9 seconds of the tour on the plus side, he did save quite a bit of fuel by allowing us to helplessly drift backwards for the vast majority of the tour while jabbering incoherently and demanding to take pictures of us with our own cameras at this point it was obvious that we were not going to travel more than 100 yards in either direction from the dock because the other pontoon tour companies zooming past us down the river were not able to create a wake large enough to mercifully capsize our boat, we had to wait out this infuriating charade our return helicopter ride did much to ease the lingering anger and despair this time around we had a new helicopter with a squeaky clean

many will love it. lynch doesn't let anything pass unmanipulated. he includes brilliant color schemes (such as the plethora of reds and pinks) with important symbolism. he makes unusual use of sound, such as the ringing telephone carrying over into the section of score that follows it (when betty first arrives at the airport). he directs his actors to deliver their lines in a plethora of bizarre ways, such as his characteristic odd pauses. he lets his odd and surprising sense of humor poke through, such as the name ""winkie's"", and the ""hot dogs--made for pinks"" sign that provides a clue to some of the color symbolism.<br /><br />lynch's attention to detail in production design provides important, subtle clues throughout the film to help one unlock the meaning. it's interesting to note that lynch even apparently demands that the dvd programming be unusual--there are no chapters on the disc; you must either watch the film in real time or fast forward or rewind to get back to particular points.<br /><br />if the surrealism and veiled meaning of the film are attractive to you, or if you're just fond of ""puzzles"", then mulholland drive is well worth watching for that aspect. there is a fairly accepted interpretation of the film, at least on a broad, generalized level. i won't recount the standard interpretation here--it is worth researching, but only after you've seen the film a couple times and have reached your own conclusions. many articles and monographs have been written on the film and interpretations;

isn't convincing, not just its creature, but acting, writing and any attempts at drama. the direction lacks any kind of flair and the script from boaz davidson and danny lerner never really works, predictable, often laughable, whilst it delivers less howlers than a fair few of these sorts of films it never offers anything to engage or raise the pulse. the actors do their best, but with such material their workmanlike efforts have little effect. matthew reilly burke is a blandly watchable hero, meredith morton similar as a blandly watchable love interest. actually she was a bit less convincing but at least she was easy on the eyes. the film at least has the dignity to bowl along at a reasonable pace, but its biggest plus is that the octopus isn't entirely cgi rendered. so even though it doesn't look good, at least there are a few legit scenes of characters inanely grappling with rubbery tentacles in pretty amusing fashion. i also chuckled at the disparities between different representations of the octopus, the cgi shots of the creature as a whole vary over the course of the film, they are also different not only in size but appearance to the practical shots of it, and there are scenes where the tentacle action suggests that the makers had abandoned pretending they were making a film about an octopus and just envisioned their creature as a bunch of miscellaneous tentacles. the scenes of the creature attacking people get old pretty swiftly, but there are a few funny scenes where it takes on other things, like a boat and a crane. yes, these scenes are poor, but they did make me chuckle. undisputable highlight though is a hilarious sequence in which the octopus takes on a new york landmark, the scene may not be much more than a minute but it really is inspired, and well worth looking up on youtube. apart from that things are uninspired all round, (a pg level lack of gore or nastiness stops this one from even pulling off much in the trash

meanwhile we are left at turns to explore the true central character of shylock. al pacino has ample dramatic weight to carry here, and he does so with convincing grit and passion. there are times when he is given room for the theatrics we have come to expect from such a colorful actor. but his most impressive scenes are the ones where he internalizes this energy, showing a conflicted personality: honest, sincere, and proud, yet brooding, vengeful and entirely remorseless. this is one of pacino's most heartfelt performances to date. and while the rest of the cast play their roles creditably and convincingly, it is pacino who really owns the film -- especially toward the end, when shakespeare upends this seeming romantic comedy with a wallop of a third act.<br /><br />i shall not reveal much here; all i can say is that it involves the initial loan -- a mighty shoe one expected would drop sooner or later. and does it ever. by the end shakespeare has raised a host of dilemmas for his audience: seemingly unresolvable questions of faith, morality, law, and mercy are thrown before us through the final scenes, and while by curtain's close the playwright's position may seem clear to some, we are left completely at odds. there are winners and losers in this one, but have the winners earned their spoils with good reason, or have they in a larger sense ended out losing as well? has virtue been rewarded, or simply flouted? has justice in fact this time been just? by the play's finish some fates are painfully clear, and unequivocally sealed. but the audience are to be the ones who really decide the verdict for all of those involved. and for some the verdict is still out for the play as well. comedy or tragedy?
